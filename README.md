## What has been customized: 

1. applications and libraries generated with nx command will be inside `./apps` and `./libs` but we moved them to the root of solution. things need to be updated: 

* project's jest.config.js
* project's tsconfig.json
* project's tsconfig.lib.json
* project's tsconfig.spec.json
* workspaces workspace.json (all paths related to this project should be updated)


2. we removed `types` key from all `tsconfig` files, just to allow to use all of installed packages.

* project's tsconfig.json
* project's tsconfig.lib.json
* project's tsconfig.spec.json


3. we added `post-install.js` to add `ts-nameof` to rollup configuration generator. It will run automatically after `npm install` 


4. we added `extra-webpack.js` to add support of fonts to React applications. currently only for `WeAre.TestApplication.WebUI`. 
we just push a plugin to the nx original webpack setting `@nrwl/react/plugins/webpack.js`   
To enable it  we need to add this to 

```
{
  "projects": {
    "PROJECT_NAME": {
      "targets": {
        "build": {
          "options": {
            "webpackConfig": "./extra-webpack"  <--
```

5. We added `extra-rollup.js` to modify our css class name for module components,we replace the postcss plugin with our own.
   To enable it  we need to add this to 

```
{
  "projects": {
    "PROJECT_NAME": {
      "targets": {
        "build": {
          "options": {
            "rollupConfig": "./extra-rollup" <--
```
